Scupper84 Row-Staggered Wee Keyboard
=====================================

The Scupper84 is an 84-key (75% layout) row-staggered keyboard in CFX
spacing to be small. The name Scupper is a reference to the Stan
Rogers song [Barrett's Privateers][barretts] which contains the lyric,
"and the cook in the scuppers with the staggers and jags," since this
keyboard uses a row-staggered design.
